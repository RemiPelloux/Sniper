# Autonomous Vulnerability Testing

## Overview

The Autonomous Vulnerability Testing module extends Sniper's capabilities with self-directed security testing features that minimize human intervention. The system can discover and evaluate security tools, generate payloads for various vulnerability types, and autonomously test applications for security weaknesses.

Key capabilities include:

* **Autonomous Tool Discovery**: Automatically finds, evaluates, and integrates new security testing tools
* **Dynamic Payload Generation**: Creates and mutates test payloads for various vulnerability types
* **Self-Learning**: Improves testing effectiveness through machine learning from past results
* **Comprehensive Scanning**: Tests for multiple vulnerability types in a single operation

## Architecture

The autonomous testing system consists of three main components:

1. **Tool Discovery**: Finds and evaluates new security testing tools
2. **Payload Generator**: Creates diverse test payloads for different vulnerability types
3. **Autonomous Tester**: Orchestrates the testing process and provides comprehensive results

## Vulnerability Types

The system can test for the following vulnerability types:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| XSS | Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities |
| SQLI | SQL Injection vulnerabilities |
| CSRF | Cross-Site Request Forgery |
| Command Injection | OS command injection vulnerabilities |
| Open Redirect | Unvalidated redirects |
| SSRF | Server-Side Request Forgery |
| Path Traversal | Directory traversal issues |
| JWT Vulnerabilities | Problems with JWT implementation |
| XML Injection | XML-related vulnerabilities |
| NoSQL Injection | Injection attacks against NoSQL databases |
| Cookie Issues | Insecure cookie configurations |
| CORS Misconfigurations | Cross-Origin Resource Sharing security issues |

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from src.ml.autonomous_tester import AutonomousTester, VulnerabilityType

# Initialize the autonomous tester
tester = AutonomousTester()

# Test for a specific vulnerability type
results = tester.test_vulnerability(
    target_url="https://example.com",
    vulnerability_type=VulnerabilityType.XSS,
    count=5  # Number of payloads to test
)

# Check results
for result in results:
    if result.success:
        print(f"Vulnerability found! Payload: {result.payload.value}")
        print(f"Evidence: {result.evidence}")
```

### Comprehensive Scanning

```python
# Run a comprehensive scan for all vulnerability types
scan_results = tester.comprehensive_scan(
    target_url="https://example.com",
    params={"id": "1", "user": "test"}  # Optional parameters to test
)

# Get a summary of the results
summary = tester.get_summary(scan_results)
print(f"Found {len(summary['vulnerabilities_found'])} vulnerability types")
```

### Discovering New Tools

```python
# Discover new security tools
new_tools = tester.discover_new_tools(max_tools=5)

# Get recommended tools for a specific vulnerability type
xss_tools = tester.tool_discovery.get_recommended_tools(
    VulnerabilityType.XSS,
    count=3
)
```

### Custom Payload Generation

```python
# Generate custom payloads for a specific vulnerability type
payloads = tester.payload_generator.generate_payloads(
    vulnerability_type=VulnerabilityType.SQLI,
    count=10,
    context="form"  # Optional context for more targeted payloads
)
```

## Machine Learning Capabilities

The autonomous testing system employs machine learning in several ways:

1. **Payload Effectiveness Learning**: Learns which payloads are most effective for different targets and vulnerability types
2. **Contextual Adaptation**: Adapts testing strategies based on target characteristics
3. **Tool Evaluation**: Learns to identify the most effective tools for different testing scenarios

The system continuously improves by recording test results and updating its models, becoming more efficient and effective over time.

## Ethical Use

This powerful autonomous testing capability must be used responsibly and ethically:

* Only test systems you own or have explicit permission to test
* Respect rate limits and avoid denial-of-service conditions
* Do not use for illegal activities or unauthorized testing
* Consider the potential impact of tests before running them

## Example

A complete example script demonstrating the autonomous testing capabilities can be found in `examples/autonomous_testing_demo.py`.

## Future Enhancements

Future versions will include:

* Integration with CI/CD pipelines for automated security testing
* More sophisticated payload generation using deep learning
* Enhanced reporting and visualization of vulnerabilities
* Expanded vulnerability coverage
* Collaborative learning across multiple instances
