**Notes:**
- Some test coverage is lower in CLI modules, which will be addressed in Sprint 3
- Documentation for each integration has been created
- All core classes have been implemented according to design

## Sprint 3 (Completed)

**Status: COMPLETED**

1. ✅ Enhanced OWASP ZAP integration with authentication support
2. ✅ Implemented basic ML model for vulnerability prediction
3. ✅ Add Docker containerization support
4. ✅ Enhance reporting module with HTML output
5. ✅ Improved documentation for all integrations
6. [ ] Add interactive CLI mode for easier usage
7. [ ] Configure CI/CD pipeline for automated testing
8. ✅ Improved test coverage for CLI modules to contribute to overall coverage goal
9. [ ] Add configuration wizard for easier setup
10. ✅ Implemented risk scoring based on scan findings

**Results:**
- ML model implementation is complete with the following features:
  - ✅ Vulnerability prediction based on finding characteristics
  - ✅ Risk scoring for prioritizing security issues
  - ✅ Feature extraction from security findings text
  - ✅ Command-line interface for model training and prediction
  - ✅ Visualization tools for analyzing findings and risk distributions
  - ✅ Example scripts for demonstrating ML capabilities
  - ✅ Finding loader utilities for parsing and handling security findings
  - ✅ Comprehensive unit tests with good coverage
- OWASP ZAP integration has been enhanced with more comprehensive documentation and improved error handling
- Docker containerization is now supported with a Dockerfile and docker-compose configuration
- HTML report generation is now implemented with:
  - ✅ Multiple templates (standard, executive, detailed)
  - ✅ Responsive design for viewing on different devices
  - ✅ Interactive elements for better user experience
  - ✅ Support for evidence inclusion/exclusion
  - ✅ Jinja2 templating for maintainable and extensible reports
- Test coverage is now at 85.62%, slightly above our target
- Documentation has been updated for all completed components

**Notes:**
- The ML model uses RandomForest classifier for vulnerability prediction
- ML module includes utilities for feature extraction and evaluation
- Risk scoring uses a weighted approach based on severity, finding type, and text characteristics
- The CLI ML module supports various output formats (JSON, CSV, text) and visualization types
- All ML module code has comprehensive unit tests with good coverage
- ML functionality is fully integrated into the main CLI interface
- Docker setup includes a dedicated OWASP ZAP service for web scanning
- HTML report templates provide professional, formatted security reports
- The reporting module now supports Markdown, HTML, and JSON output formats

## Sprint 4 (Planned)

2. [ ] Create web dashboard for visualizing scan results
3. [ ] Add scheduled scan functionality
4. [ ] Enhance ML model with more sophisticated algorithms
5. [ ] Implement user authentication for API access
6. [ ] Create plugin system for extending functionality
7. [ ] Integrate additional vulnerability databases
8. [ ] Improve ML feature extraction from findings
9. [ ] Add support for custom scanning rules
10. [ ] Implement scan comparison feature
11. [ ] Enhance Docker deployment with multi-stage builds
12. [ ] Create Kubernetes deployment configurations

**Deferred from Previous Sprints:**

2. Add support for cloud deployment (AWS, Azure, GCP)
3. Create mobile companion app for monitoring scans
4. Implement advanced reporting with trend analysis
5. Add third-party integrations (Slack, JIRA, etc.)

**Note:** The focus of Sprint 4 is on API development, ML enhancement, and completing the remaining tasks from Sprint 3.
