# Sprint 2: Tool Integration Framework

**Note:** Deferred tasks from Sprint 1 (Tool Detection Framework, CLI Unit Tests, Core Mocks, Coverage Reporting) still need to be addressed in future sprints or integrated as appropriate.

## Integration Architecture

-   [x] feat(integrations): Design abstract base classes for tool integration
-   [~] feat(integrations): Implement execution strategies (subprocess, API, Docker) (Subprocess done)
-   [ ] feat(integrations): Create output parsers for common tool formats
-   [~] feat(integrations): Build execution timeout and interrupt handling (Timeout in executor done, Interrupt handling deferred)
-   [x] feat(integrations): Implement tool-specific configuration management

## Core Tool Integrations

-   [x] feat(integrations): Implement Nmap integration for basic port scanning
-   [ ] feat(integrations): Create OWASP ZAP integration for web scanning
-   [x] feat(integrations): Implement Dirsearch/Gobuster for directory enumeration
-   [x] feat(integrations): Create Sublist3r/Amass for subdomain discovery (Sublist3r integrated)
-   [ ] feat(integrations): Build Wappalyzer/Webanalyze for tech detection

## Result Normalization

-   [x] feat(results): Create common result data models
-   [~] feat(results): Implement result parsers for each integrated tool (Nmap, Dirsearch, Sublist3r refactored)
-   [ ] feat(results): Build deduplication system for overlapping results
-   [ ] feat(results): Create severity normalization across different tools
-   [ ] feat(results): Implement finding correlation system

## Unit Tests

-   [ ] test(integrations): Create mock tool outputs for testing
-   [x] test(integrations): Implement tests for each tool integration (Nmap, Dirsearch, Sublist3r tests done)
-   [~] test(results): Test result normalization and parsing (Basic parser tests updated)
-   [ ] test(integrations): Create integration tests for tool execution flow
-   [ ] test(integrations): Test error handling and recovery mechanisms

# --- Deferred from Sprint 1 ---
-   [ ] test(cli): Implement unit tests for core CLI components (Basic tests added)
-   [ ] chore(test): Implement test coverage reporting (pytest-cov configured)
-   [ ] feat(tools): Create tool registry system
-   [ ] feat(tools): Implement tool detection mechanism
-   [ ] feat(tools): Build system for checking tool prerequisites
-   [ ] feat(tools): Create Docker-based fallback mechanism for missing tools
-   [ ] feat(tools): Implement version checking for installed tools
-   [ ] test(core): Create mocks for tool execution

# --- Sprint 1 Completed Tasks --- 

# Sprint 1: Project Foundation & Core Architecture

## Environment Setup

-   [ ] chore(setup): Initialize Git repository with proper structure (Assuming already done in workspace)
-   [x] feat(setup): Create Python project using Poetry for dependency management
-   [x] chore(setup): Configure development environment (.gitignore, .editorconfig)
-   [x] chore(setup): Set up linting and code formatting tools (black, flake8, isort, mypy)
-   [x] chore(setup): Configure pytest for testing infrastructure
-   [x] chore(docs): Create initial documentation structure (Partially done)

## Core CLI Framework

-   [x] feat(cli): Implement basic CLI structure using Click/Typer
-   [x] feat(cli): Create command parser for core operations (scan, report, tools, ml)
-   [x] feat(core): Implement URL validation and target handling
-   [x] feat(core): Add configuration management system
-   [x] feat(core): Create logging infrastructure
-   [x] feat(cli): Build help and documentation system

## Tool Detection Framework (Deferred)

## Unit Tests (Deferred & Partial)
-   [x] test(core): Test URL validation functionality
-   [x] test(core): Test configuration management
