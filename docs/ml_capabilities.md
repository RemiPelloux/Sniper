# Machine Learning Capabilities in Sniper

Sniper incorporates advanced machine learning capabilities to enhance the effectiveness of security testing and vulnerability detection. This document outlines the key ML features and their implementation.

## Core ML Components

### 1. Vulnerability Prediction (VulnerabilityPredictor)

The `VulnerabilityPredictor` class provides risk assessment and severity classification of security findings.

**Capabilities:**
- Feature extraction from security findings
- Risk score calculation based on multiple factors
- Classification of findings by severity
- Confidence evaluation for vulnerability assessment

**Implementation:** `src/ml/model.py`

### 2. Smart Reconnaissance (SmartRecon)

The `SmartRecon` class implements intelligent reconnaissance strategies, tool selection, and adaptive vulnerability discovery.

**Capabilities:**
- Tool selection optimization based on target characteristics
- Pattern recognition for vulnerability identification
- Learning from historical bug bounty reports
- Case adaptation from similar vulnerability scenarios

**Implementation:** `src/ml/smart_recon.py`

## Key Machine Learning Features

### Intelligent Tool Selection

Sniper can intelligently select the most appropriate security tools based on the target's characteristics:

- Analyzes target information (services, ports, technologies)
- Recommends the most effective tools for the specific reconnaissance scenario
- Prioritizes tools based on their historical effectiveness for similar targets
- Adapts recommendations as more information is gathered

### Pattern Recognition

The system can identify patterns across multiple findings that may indicate vulnerabilities:

- Clusters similar findings to identify potential vulnerability patterns
- Recognizes commonalities that might represent a security weakness
- Prioritizes patterns based on risk assessment

### Bug Bounty Report Learning

Sniper learns from historical bug bounty reports to improve vulnerability detection:

- Extracts key features from paid bug bounty reports
- Identifies vulnerability patterns that have been successfully exploited
- Adapts testing strategies based on successful vulnerabilities found in similar systems

### Case-Based Adaptation

The system identifies similar cases from past data and adapts strategies to find new vulnerabilities:

- Matches current target characteristics with historical cases
- Recommends testing strategies based on successful past approaches
- Suggests specific actions tailored to the current target

## Training the ML Models

Sniper's ML models can be trained using:

1. Historical security scan results
2. Confirmed vulnerability data
3. Bug bounty reports
4. Synthetically generated training data

## Implementation Details

### Model Types

Sniper uses a variety of machine learning algorithms:

- **Random Forest Classifier**: For tool selection and vulnerability classification
- **K-Means Clustering**: For pattern recognition across findings
- **Feature-based scoring**: For risk assessment

### Data Flow

1. Target information is analyzed to select optimal tools
2. Scan results are processed to extract features
3. Patterns are identified across multiple findings
4. Similar historical cases are matched to provide recommendations
5. Results are ranked by confidence and severity

## Future Enhancements

- Deep learning models for more accurate vulnerability prediction
- Reinforcement learning for adaptive testing strategies
- Natural language processing for better extraction of information from textual descriptions
- Active learning to improve model accuracy with minimal human input
