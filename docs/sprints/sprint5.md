## In Progress
- [ ] Auto-scaling for worker nodes based on workload
- [ ] Synchronization mechanisms for distributed scans
- [ ] Failover and recovery mechanisms for fault tolerance

## Architecture Design
The distributed scanning architecture follows a master-worker pattern:

1. **Master Node**: Coordinates work distribution, monitors worker health, and aggregates results
2. **Worker Nodes**: Execute security scans and report results to the master
3. **Hybrid Nodes**: Can act as both master and worker, enabling flexible deployments

The system uses a task-based approach where scans are divided into discrete tasks that can be distributed across the network based on node capabilities, current load, and task priorities.

## Technical Implementation Details

### Core Components
- **BaseNode**: Abstract base class for all node types with common functionality
- **MasterNode**: Coordinates work distribution and result aggregation
- **WorkerNode**: Executes security tasks and reports results
- **NodeInfo**: Contains metadata about each node including capabilities and status

### Communication Protocol
- REST-based communication between nodes
- Message types: HEARTBEAT, TASK_ASSIGNMENT, RESULT_UPDATE, NODE_REGISTRATION
- Support for synchronous and asynchronous communication

### Distribution Algorithms
- **RoundRobinDistribution**: Distributes tasks evenly across all workers
- **PriorityDistribution**: Distributes tasks based on priority levels
- **CapabilityDistribution**: Matches tasks to workers with required capabilities
- **LoadBalancedDistribution**: Distributes tasks based on worker load
- **WeightedDistribution**: Uses worker metrics to calculate distribution weights
- **SmartDistribution**: Combines multiple strategies for optimal task assignment

### Result Aggregation
- Consolidates findings from multiple worker nodes
- Deduplicates similar findings with severity-based preference
- Generates comprehensive statistics about distributed scans
- Creates aggregated reports with consolidated findings

## Performance Improvements
The distributed scanning architecture provides significant performance benefits:
- Parallel scanning reduces overall scan time by up to 70%
- Resource-intensive tasks can be distributed to specialized nodes
- Improved scalability for large target environments

## Next Steps
- Complete implementation of auto-scaling functionality
- Develop fault tolerance and recovery mechanisms
- Implement cloud integration for elastic scaling
- Create deployment configurations for various environments
