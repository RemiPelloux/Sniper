- **Scalability**: The architecture supports horizontal scaling by adding more worker nodes without code changes
- **Documentation**: Created comprehensive architecture documentation covering deployment models, communication patterns, and best practices

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge: Consistent Task State Management
**Solution**: Implemented thread-safe operations with locking mechanisms and atomic updates to ensure consistent task state across worker and master nodes.

### Challenge: Efficient Worker Selection
**Solution**: Created specialized distribution algorithms that consider multiple factors (load, capabilities, historical performance) to optimize worker selection.

### Challenge: Network Failures
**Solution**: Implemented heartbeat mechanism and timeout detection to identify and handle communication failures between nodes.

## Next Steps

- Complete REST API implementation for node communication
- Implement persistence layer for state management
- Develop monitoring dashboard for distributed system health
- Create container deployment configuration (Docker Compose)
- Add auto-scaling scripts for cloud environments
- Test the system with large-scale scanning scenarios

## Technical Debt & Future Improvements

- Consider implementing additional communication protocols (gRPC, WebSockets)
- Add machine learning capabilities to the smart distribution algorithm
- Improve result streaming for large scan outputs
- Implement more sophisticated worker health monitoring
- Develop hierarchical deployment capabilities for extremely large-scale operations

## Team Notes

The distributed scanning architecture represents a significant advancement in the Sniper Security Tool's capabilities. This implementation enables the tool to scale horizontally to handle large-scale security scanning operations while maintaining fault tolerance and efficient resource utilization.

The architecture is designed with flexibility in mind, allowing for various deployment models from simple single-master setups to complex hierarchical deployments across multiple networks or regions.
