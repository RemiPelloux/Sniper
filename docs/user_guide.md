## 1. Introduction

Sniper is designed to automate and enhance security testing processes. It integrates various security tools, utilizes machine learning for analysis, and provides a flexible plugin architecture for extensibility.

*(More details about philosophy and goals can be added here)*

## 2. Installation

We recommend using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for managing dependencies and the virtual environment.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url> sniper
cd sniper

# Install dependencies using Poetry
poetry install

# Activate the virtual environment (optional, commands can be run via 'poetry run')
poetry shell
```

## 3. Core Concepts

Understanding these core concepts is key to using Sniper effectively:

*   **Targets:** The systems, applications, or networks being assessed.
*   **Scans:** The process of running security tools against targets to identify potential vulnerabilities or gather information.
*   **Findings:** Individual pieces of information discovered during a scan (e.g., a vulnerability, an open port, misconfiguration).
*   **Reports:** Aggregated and processed findings, often presented in a structured format (JSON, HTML, etc.).
*   **Tools:** Specific security utilities integrated into Sniper (e.g., Nmap, OWASP ZAP, custom scripts).
*   **Machine Learning (ML):** Sniper utilizes ML models for tasks like predicting vulnerability severity or prioritizing findings.
*   **Plugins:** Extend Sniper's functionality. They can add new commands, integrate tools, or modify behavior (e.g., Sandbox Plugin).
*   **Sandbox:** An isolated environment (often using Docker) for running potentially unsafe tools or analyzing artifacts.

## 4. CLI Usage

Sniper is primarily controlled via its command-line interface (CLI). Use `poetry run sniper --help` to see all available commands and options.

### Scanning

Initiate scans against specified targets.

```bash
# Example: Run a default scan profile against a target
poetry run sniper scan <target_host_or_ip> --profile default

# Example: Run specific tools
poetry run sniper scan <target_host_or_ip> --tools nmap zap

# Example: Save findings to a specific file
poetry run sniper scan <target_host_or_ip> -o results.json
```

*(More details on scan profiles, target formats, specific tool options)*

### Reporting

Generate reports from scan findings.

```bash
# Example: Generate an HTML report from findings
poetry run sniper report findings.json --format html -o report.html
```

*(More details on report formats, filtering, customization)*

### Tools Management

Manage integrated security tools.

```bash
# List available tools
poetry run sniper tools list

# Get info about a specific tool
poetry run sniper tools info nmap
```

*(More details on adding/configuring tools if applicable)*

### Machine Learning

Interact with Sniper's ML capabilities.

```bash
# Example: Train an ML model (if applicable)
poetry run sniper ml train --data <training_data>

# Example: Predict using a model
poetry run sniper ml predict --model <model_name> --input <input_data>
```

*(More details on available ML models, training data formats, prediction outputs)*

### Custom Tools

Manage and run custom tools defined by the user.

```bash
# List custom tools
poetry run sniper custom-tools list

# Run a specific custom tool
poetry run sniper custom-tools run <tool_name> --target <target>
```

*(More details on defining and configuring custom tools)*

### Sandbox Plugin

Commands provided by the Sandbox plugin (if enabled).

```bash
# List sandbox environments
poetry run sniper sandbox list

# Start the default sandbox
poetry run sniper sandbox start

# Stop the sandbox
poetry run sniper sandbox stop

# Check sandbox status
poetry run sniper sandbox status
```

*(See Section 6 for more details)*

### Other Plugins

Plugins add their own subcommands. Use `--help` to explore them.

```bash
# Example: Help for a hypothetical 'MyScanner' plugin
poetry run sniper myscanner --help

poetry run sniper myscanner run --help
```

## 5. Configuration

Sniper's behavior can be customized through configuration files.

*   **Main Configuration:** `config/config.yaml` (or location specified by `SNIPER_CONFIG_PATH`). Controls core settings, logging, tool paths, ML model paths, etc.
*   **Plugin Configuration:** Plugins might have their own configuration files or sections within the main config.
*   **Environment Variables:** Certain settings can be overridden via environment variables (e.g., `LOG_LEVEL`).

*(More details on specific configuration options, format, priorities)*

## 6. Using the Sandbox Plugin

The Sandbox plugin provides an isolated Docker environment.

**Prerequisites:**
*   Docker and Docker Compose (or `docker compose`) must be installed and running.

**Usage:**
*   Use `poetry run sniper sandbox start` to launch the environment defined in `app/plugins/sandbox/docker-compose.yml`.
*   Use `poetry run sniper sandbox stop` to shut it down.
*   Use `poetry run sniper sandbox status` to check if it's running.

*(More details on customizing the sandbox, interacting with it, use cases)*

## 7. Troubleshooting

*   **Check Logs:** Increase log verbosity (`--log-level DEBUG` or set `LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG`) for detailed information. Logs are typically found in a `logs/` directory.
*   **Dependencies:** Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed (`poetry install`).
*   **Permissions:** Verify Sniper has the necessary permissions to run tools, write files, or access network resources.
*   **Plugin Issues:** Check plugin-specific logs or documentation. Ensure plugin prerequisites (like Docker for the sandbox) are met.

*(List common errors and solutions)*
